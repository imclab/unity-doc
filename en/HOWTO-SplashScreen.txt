! How do I make a Splash Screen?

!!Desktop
Here's how to do a splash screen or any other type of full-screen image in Unity. This method works for multiple resolutions and aspect ratios.

# First you need a big texture. Ideally textures should be power of two in size. You might for example use 1024x512 as this fits most screens.
# Make a box using the ^^GameObject->Create Other->Cube^^ menubar item.
# Scale it to be in 16:9 format by entering 16 and 9 as the first two value in the Scale:\\

# Drag the texture onto the cube and make the $$Camera$$ point at it. Place the camera at such a distance so that the cube is still visible on a 16:9 aspect ratio.  Use the $$Aspect Ratio Selector$$ in the $$Scene View$$ menu bar to see the end result.
