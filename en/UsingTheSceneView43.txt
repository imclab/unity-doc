! Using the Scene View

The $$Scene View$$ is your interactive sandbox. You will use the Scene View to select and position environments, the player, the camera, enemies, and all other $$GameObjects$$. Maneuvering and manipulating objects within the Scene View are some of the most important functions in Unity, so it's important to be able to do them quickly.
