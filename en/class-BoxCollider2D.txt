!Box Collider 2D

The $$Box Collider 2D$$ component is a collider for use with 2D physics. The collider's shape is a rectangle with a given position, width and height in the local coordinate space of a $$Sprite$$. Note that the rectangle is axis-aligned, ie, its edges are parallel to the X or Y axes of local space.
