! Rendering Paths

Unity supports different $$Rendering Paths$$. You should choose which one you use depending on your game content and target platform / hardware. Different rendering paths have different features and performance characteristics that mostly affect Lights and Shadows.

The rendering Path used by your project is chosen in [[class-PlayerSettings40 | Player Settings]]. Additionally, you can override it for each [[class-Camera | Camera]].

If the graphics card can't handle a selected rendering path, Unity will automatically use a lower fidelity one. So on a GPU that can't handle Deferred Lighting, Forward Rendering will be used. If Forward Rendering is not supported, Vertex Lit will be used.


[[#deferredlighting]]
!! Deferred Lighting

$$Deferred Lighting$$ is the rendering path with the most lighting and shadow fidelity. It is best used if you have many realtime lights. It requires a certain level of hardware support, is for __Unity Pro__ only.

For more details see the __[[RenderTech-DeferredLighting | Deferred Lighting page]]__.


[[#forward]]
!! Forward Rendering

$$Forward$$ is a shader-based rendering path. It supports per-pixel lighting (including normal maps & light Cookies) and realtime shadows from one directional light. In the default settings, a small number of the brightest lights are rendered in per-pixel lighting mode. The rest of the lights are calculated at object vertices.

For more details see the __[[RenderTech-ForwardRendering | Forward Rendering page]]__.


[[#vertexlit]]
!! Vertex Lit

$$Vertex Lit$$ is the rendering path with the lowest lighting fidelity and no support for realtime shadows. It is best used on old machines or limited mobile platforms.

For more details see the __[[RenderTech-VertexLit | Vertex Lit page]]__.
