! Blur Effect

__This is now deprecated. Use [[script-Blur|Blur]] instead.__

The $$Blur$$ image effect blurs the rendered image in real-time.

As with the other [[comp-ImageEffects|image effects]], this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets|Pro Standard Assets]] installed before it becomes available.

||PROPS
||``Iterations`` ||The number of times the basic blur operation will be repeated. More iterations typically give a better result but each has a cost in processing time. ||
||``Blur Spread`` ||Higher values will spread out the blur more at the same iteration count but at some cost in quality. Usually values from 0.6 to 0.7 are a good compromise between quality and speed. ||
