! Physics Material 2D

A $$Physics Material 2D$$ is used to adjust the friction and bounce that occurs between 2D physics objects when they collide. You can create a Physics Material 2D from the Assets menu (^^Assets > Create > Physics Material 2D^^ ).

!!Properties

||PROPS
||``Friction`` ||Coefficient of friction for this collider. ||
||``Bounciness`` ||The degree to which collisions rebound from the surface. A value of 0 indicates no bounce while a value of 1 indicates a perfect bounce with no loss of energy. ||


!! Details
To use a Physics Material 2D, simply drag it onto an object with a 2D collider attached or drag it to the collider component in the inspector. Note that for 3D physics, the equivalent asset is referred to as a ''Physic Material'' (ie, no S at the end of ''physic'') - it is important in scripting not to get the two spellings confused.
