! Android Scripting

Most features of the Android devices are exposed through the [[ScriptRef:Input.html | Input]] and [[ScriptRef:Handheld.html | Handheld]] classes.  For cross-platform projects, UNITY_ANDROID is defined for conditionally compiling Android-specific C# code.

For further information, see the [[Input]], [[MobileKeyboard|Mobile Keyboard]], [[MobileAdvanced|Advanced Unity Mobile Scripting]] and [[MobileDotnet|Using .NET API 2.0 compatibility level]] pages.
