||PROPS
||``Radius``||Agent radius (used for pathfinding purposes only, and can differ from the actual object's radius, typically larger). ||
||``Speed`` ||Maximum movement speed with which the agent can traverse the world toward its destination.||
||``Acceleration`` ||Maximum acceleration.||
||``Angular Speed`` ||Maximum rotation speed in (deg/s).||
||``Stopping distance`` ||Stopping distance. The agent will decelerate when within this distance to the destination.||
||``Auto Traverse OffMesh Link``	||Automate movement onto and off of OffMeshLinks.
||``Auto Repath`` ||Acquire new path if existing is partial or invalid.
||``Auto Braking`` ||
||``Height``||The height of the agent (used in debug graphics).
||``Base offset`` ||Vertical offset of the collision geometry relative to the actual geometry.
||``Obstacle Avoidance Type`` ||The level of quality of avoidance.
||``Avoidance Priority`` ||Agents of lower priority will be ignored by this agent when performing avoidance. The value should be in the range 0..99 where lower numbers indicate higher priority. ||
||``NavMesh Walkable`` ||Specifies the types of [[class-NavMeshLayers|Navmesh layers]] that the agent can traverse.
