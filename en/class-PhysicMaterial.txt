! Physics Material

The $$Physics Material$$ is used to adjust friction and bouncing effects of colliding objects.

To create a Physics Material select ^^Assets->Create->Physics Material^^ from the menu bar.  Then drag the Physics Material from the Project View onto a $$Collider$$ in the scene.

!! Properties

||PROPS
||``Dynamic Friction`` ||The friction used when already moving. Usually a value from 0 to 1. A value of zero feels like ice, a value of 1 will make it come to rest very quickly unless a lot of force or gravity pushes the object. ||
||``Static Friction`` ||The friction used when an object is laying still on a surface. Usually a value from 0 to 1. A value of zero feels like ice, a value of 1 will make it very hard to get the object moving. ||
||``Bounciness`` ||How bouncy is the surface? A value of 0 will not bounce. A value of 1 will bounce without any loss of energy. ||
||``Friction Combine`` ||How the friction of two colliding objects is combined.||
||>>>``Average`` ||The two friction values are averaged. ||
||>>>``Minimum`` ||The smallest of the two values is used. ||
||>>>``Maximum`` ||The largest of the two values is used. ||
||>>>``Multiply`` ||The friction values are multiplied with each other. ||
|| ||When two bodies are in contact, bounciness and friction modes are applied individually to each agent. So, when body A has mode ``Average`` and body B has mode ``Multiply``, then A is going to behave according to average parameters and B according to multiplied parameters.||
||``Bounce Combine`` ||How the bounciness of two colliding objects is combined. It has the same modes as Friction Combine Mode ||
||``Friction Direction 2`` ||The direction of anisotropy. Anisotropic friction is enabled if this direction is not zero. Dynamic Friction 2 and Static Friction 2 will be applied along Friction Direction 2. ||
||``Dynamic Friction 2`` ||If anisotropic friction is enabled, DynamicFriction2 will be applied along Friction Direction 2. ||
||``Static Friction 2`` ||If anisotropic friction is enabled, StaticFriction2 will be applied along Friction Direction 2. ||


!! Details

Friction is the quantity which prevents surfaces from sliding off each other. This value is critical when trying to stack objects. Friction comes in two forms, dynamic and static. ``Static friction`` is used when the object is lying still. It will prevent the object from starting to move. If a large enough force is applied to the object it will start moving. At this point ``Dynamic Friction`` will come into play. ``Dynamic Friction`` will now attempt to slow down the object while in contact with another.

!!Hints
* Don't try to use a standard physics material for the main character. Make a customized one and get it perfect.
