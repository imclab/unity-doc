!Slider Joint 2D

The $$Slider Joint 2D$$ component allows a $$Sprite$$ object controlled by rigidbody physics to slide along a line in space. The object can optionally be left free to move anywhere along the line in response to collisions or forces. It can also be moved along by a motor force and have limits applied to keep its position within a certain section of the line.

||PROPS
||``Collide Connected`` ||Can the two connected objects collide with each other? ||
||``Connected Rigidbody`` ||The other Rigidbody2D object that the one with the joint is connected to. If this is null then the othen end of the joint will be fixed at a point in space. ||
||``Anchor`` ||Coordinate in local space where the end point of the joint is attached. ||
||``Connected Anchor`` ||Coordinate in the other object's local space where its end of the joint is attached. ||
||``Angle`` ||The angle of the line relative to the other rigidbody (or world space). ||
||``Use Motor`` ||Should the sliding motor be enabled? ||
||``Motor Speed`` ||Target motor speed (units/sec). ||
||``Maximum Motor Force`` ||The maximum force the motor can apply while attempting to reach the target speed. ||
||``Lower Translation`` ||The minimum distance the rigidbody object can be from the connected anchor point. ||
||``Upper Translation`` ||The maximum distance the rigidbody object can be from the connected anchor point. ||

!!Details
The Slider Joint can be used for sliding objects such as doors but also for any objects that follow a simple, straight path. Such objects might include simple characters, obstacles that rise or fall from their surroundings, projectiles and many other common game elements.
